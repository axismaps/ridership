        <h2>Transit Insights Methodology</h2>
        <p>Transit Insights displays changes in public transit ridership, service characteristics, and demographics for the 55 most populous U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and their transit agencies. TransitCenter partnered with <a href="https://axismaps.com/" target="_blank">Axis Maps</a> to build the tool.</p>
        <p>Transit data are from 2006 to 2017, collected from the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/ntd-data" target="_blank"> National Transit Database</a> (NTD). The highest-ridership transit agencies per MSA are displayed individually, and the rest are aggregated into &ldquo;Other.&rdquo; Agency data are assigned by headquarter location for MSA-level tabulations. Bus ridership includes &ldquo;unlinked passenger trips&rdquo; (UPTs) on local, express, commuter, and trolley buses. Rail ridership includes UPTs on light, heavy, commuter, hybrid, and streetcar rail, as well as on monorail and cable car. Transit ridership and other indicators are reported for all modes. All transit indicators are presented as percent change.</p>
        <p>Demographic data are from the U.S. Census Bureau's 5-year <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/" target="_blank">American Community Survey</a> estimates from 2010 to 2016. Jobs data are from the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s <a href="https://lehd.ces.census.gov/" target="_blank"> Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics</a> estimates from 2010 to 2015. All demographic indicators are presented as absolute, percentage point change, except for total population, median household income, and density (presented as percent change).</p>
        <p>Transit service shapefiles and frequency designations are from 2018. <a href="https://interline.io/" target="_blank">Interline</a> exported the data from the <a href="https://transit.land/" target="_blank">TransitLand</a> API. Transit service shapefiles for Memphis, Tennessee and Richmond, Virginia are unavailable. Note: low-frequency service is only visible by zooming in from the regional map view.</p>
